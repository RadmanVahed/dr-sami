  categories:
    - title: "Services & Treatment Process"
      questions:
        - label: "What services do you provide?"
          content: |
            Dr. Sami’s Pulmonary Clinic offers specialized diagnostic and therapeutic services for respiratory and lung diseases — including asthma and allergy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, interstitial lung disease (ILD), lung cancer screening, bronchoscopy, and pulmonary function tests such as spirometry.
        - label: "How does the consultation and treatment process work?"
          content: |
            You can schedule an appointment through the online booking form or by phone.
            During the initial visit, a thorough physical examination and medical history review are performed. If necessary, diagnostic tests such as spirometry or imaging are requested. Based on the results, an individualized treatment plan will be prepared.
        - label: "Do you offer online consultations?"
          content: |
            Yes, remote consultations are available for out-of-town patients or for follow-up cases.
            You can upload your test results or scans before the session so Dr. Sami can review them in advance.
        - label: "Do you also treat children?"
          content: |
            Yes. Pediatric asthma and allergy evaluations are available.
            Diagnosis and treatment are tailored to each child’s age, condition, and medical background.

    - title: "Appointments & Scheduling"
      questions:
        - label: "How can I book an appointment?"
          content: |
            Appointments can be booked online through the website’s reservation page or by calling the clinic directly.
            Once your appointment is confirmed, you’ll receive a confirmation and reminder message.
        - label: "What are the clinic’s working hours?"
          content: |
            The clinic operates from Saturday to Wednesday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
            Online appointments are available subject to availability.
        - label: "How long does each visit take?"
          content: |
            The initial consultation usually takes about 30 minutes to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.
            Follow-up visits or result reviews typically last 10–15 minutes.
        - label: "What if I need to cancel my appointment?"
          content: |
            Please notify the clinic at least 24 hours in advance so your time slot can be reassigned.
            If canceled in time, rebooking is possible without any extra charge.

    - title: "Medical Questions"
      questions:
        - label: "When should I see a pulmonologist?"
          content: |
            If you experience persistent cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, or symptoms of sleep apnea, it’s best to get evaluated by a lung specialist to identify the cause and begin proper treatment.
        - label: "What’s the difference between asthma and COPD?"
          content: |
            Asthma often begins early in life and can be well controlled with medication.
            COPD, however, generally occurs in adults over 40 — especially smokers — and involves permanent lung damage, making it less reversible.
        - label: "Is spirometry painful?"
          content: |
            No, spirometry is completely non-invasive and painless.
            It simply measures your breathing capacity by having you inhale and exhale deeply into a specialized device.
